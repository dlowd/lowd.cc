UNIX for Poets is well-written and has lots of examples.  However, it's
focused on natural language processing in particular, and it's a little
dated.  For instance, some of the commands might have different options
than in the article.  It also leaves out some very useful things such as
bash scripting.  Here's an example:

for i in *.xmod; do
echo $i `grep -c "<Leaf>" $i`
done

If you have the list of filenames in a file, you can also do things like this:

for i in `cat files.txt`; do
echo $i `grep -c "<Leaf>" $i`
done

And if you have a set of experiments to run, I find it very handy to
write things like this:

for dataset in genetics bibtex medical; do
for parameter1 in 0.01 0.1 1 10 100; do
for parameter2 in 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5; do
run_learning_program -p1 $parameter1 -p2 $parameter2 ${dataset}.data >
${dataset}-${parameter1}-${parameter2}.log
done
done
done

Then you can analyze all the results similarly, with something like this:

for dataset in genetics bibtex medical; do
for parameter1 in 0.01 0.1 1 10 100; do
for parameter2 in 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5; do
echo $dataset $parameter1 $parameter2 `grep "Final results"
${dataset}-${parameter1}-${parameter2}.log | awk '{print $3}'`
done
done
done

The braces around the variable names clarify that the - and .log
aren't part of the variable name.  Here, they're actually unnecessary,
because punctuation usually delimits variable names.  The "awk"
command is introduced and explained in the UNIX for Poets PDF file.

Running lots of experiments like this will, of course, make more sense
once I find some better computational resources for you. (-:

Bash also lets you set variables and reuse them in general, e.g.:

expdir=/homes/users/lowd/research/projects/2009/summer/august/my-project/experiments/new
run_test -i ${expdir}/foo.data -o ${expdir}/foo.model > ${expdir}/foo.log

However, variables that you set are local to the current terminal and
expire when closed.  (Note: Only use a dollar sign ($) when asking for
the value of a variable, not when initially assigning it, or you'll
get errors.)
