To His Uncompleted Theory Homework

Had I but brains enough, and time,
This problem set would be just fine.
I would sit down and count each way
To prove the truth of theorem A.
And when I came to theorem B,
I could proceed exhaustively
When n is 1, then 2, 3, 4...
(To just induct would be a bore.)
Theorem C obviously comes
Straight from Peano's axioms.
See Whitehead for an intro text:
My answer set would be the next.
An omnibus of copious length,
Rigorous method, perfect strength.
Such worthy questions, bold and clear,
Deserve ten thousand pages here.

But even now, I start to feel
The need for sleep, to rest, to heal.
And in this finite life we find
Too little time, too little mind.
So write this on my epitaph:
``Had he but time enough for math...''

(Inspired by "To His Coy Mistress," by Andrew Marvell, one of the most famous
come-ons ever written.)
