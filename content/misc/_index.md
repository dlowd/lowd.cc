## Transportation

I regularly commute by unicycle. During the 2012 [Business Commute Challenge](https://www.commutechallenge.org/) I needed something even more unusual, so Star Holmberg lent me a small plush llama. Together, the llama and I logged more than 20 miles on the “unillama” that week—surely a record of some kind.

## CSE Poetry

- [Villanelle on computer architecture](/files/villanelle.txt) — written to earn a one-week extension on an architecture project.  
- [Final exam question](/files/archfinal.txt) — I wrote my own exam question and answered it. Full credit!  
- [Theory-inspired creativity](/files/theoryhomework.txt) — from an advanced complexity course.  

## Music

I occasionally write and perform geeky songs:

- [Space is Big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjvZa0GqeGI) — a simple song about a simple fact.  
- [Otterly Adore You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czkSpfyDZEk) — an otter love song.  
- [Alternate Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcYhE2QK1gQ) — when competing with yourself backfires.  
- [Walking in the Moonlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROf7R2KsNrA) — bittersweet werewolf love.  
- [Have You Ever Seen a Whale?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMnDqmmg25U) — the truth is out there.  
- [Tentacle Tenure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV68os23sP0) — Cthulhu applies for a faculty position.
