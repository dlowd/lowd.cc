This page collects resources and personal advice for students doing research with me. Much of it applies broadly to graduate study in computer science and machine learning.

## Core Skills

- **Learn UNIX.** Master the command line and standard utilities so you can automate tasks and work efficiently. GUIs and IDEs are great, but many research workflows are faster in the shell.  
- **Use a powerful editor.** Vim, Emacs, and modern editors like Sublime or VS Code all work—as long as you can navigate quickly, automate repetitive edits, and stay productive.  
- **Script everything.** Bash and tools such as Python make it easy to reproduce experiments, manipulate data, and document your process. Accept command-line arguments and version scripts alongside your code.  
- **Track your work.** Use version control for code, writing, and experimental results. Keep off-site backups. Losing results to a disk failure is avoidable.  

## Writing Matters

Academic life involves a lot of writing. Clear communication often determines whether a paper is accepted. Practice regularly, read good writing, and seek feedback.

- **Master grammar and punctuation.** Use reference guides and ask for help where needed.  
- **Learn LaTeX.** It is the standard for technical writing in our field.  
- **Follow community conventions.** Understand the notation, terminology, and rhetorical patterns used in your research area.  
- **Write clearly.** Structure arguments for readability, keep sentences focused, and use examples generously. Clarity improves with practice.
